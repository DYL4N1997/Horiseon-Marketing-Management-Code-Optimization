Homework week 01, refactoring code for Horiseon's landing page to optimize for accessibility standards.

URL of Github repository = https://dyl4n1997.github.io/Horiseon-Marketing-Management-Code-Optimization/

The purpose of this project was to refactor the code, so the Horiseon website would follow accessbility standards and be optimized for search engines like Google Chrome.

To acheive this purpose a number of refactoring criteria was met

1. Semantic elements describing header, sections, and footers were added to the HTML.

2. The logical structure of the HTML code was re-ordered, with the purpose of making it more readbale, inclusing the addtiion of tags.

3. 'Alt' attributes were added to the image and icon elements, making it more accessbile.

4. The heading elements were amended in the HTML file to fall in sequential order and sizing.

5. A title of 'Horiseon Marketing Management' was replaced 'website' as the title desciption element. 

6. Application navabr links forward to the relevant images

7. CCS selectors an properties in style.css, match HTML semantic strcuture.

8. Comments were added to the CSS file to describe purposes of the styling.
